## DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE, IT IS A TEMPLATE. THAT YOU NEED TO COPY
# Prusa MK2.5s Klipper Config

# The first thing you'll need to do is go through this file and comment out / uncomment
# the files and/or settings you need.

# You'll be able to print just fine with this config as it is, but it is recommended
# that you follow these steps to properly calibrate your printer:

# 0) Sanity check and PID Tuning: https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_checks.html
# 1) Pressure Advance: https://www.klipper3d.org/Pressure_Advance.html
# 2) Skew Correction: https://www.klipper3d.org/skew_correction.html
# 3) Resonance Compensation: https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html

## For faster printing enable
# [printer]
# max_accel: 2000
# max_accel_to_decel: 2000
# max_z_velocity: 20
# max_z_accel: 300

## For stealth mode enable

# [tmc2130 stepper_y]
# interpolate: True
# stealthchop_threshold: 80

# FIRST RUN: 
# Execute these sequentially in the console, let PID tuning finish before saving
# PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=extruder TARGET=170
# SAVE_CONFIG
# PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=60
# SAVE_CONFIG

### The end, on the end the printer will store it's tuning data, so do not edit it.
